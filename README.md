For Hindi, the model was fine-tuned using datasets that capture the rich phonetic diversity of the language. The results showed significant improvements in naturalness, prosody, and pronunciation when compared to pre-trained models like Coqui TTS. The use of SpeechT5 for multi-language tasks, especially in resource-constrained languages like Hindi, highlights its ability to generate high-quality, intelligible speech that meets the needs of native speakers.

The development of a Gradio interface allows for easy text-to-speech conversion, making it accessible for testing and further development. The comparison of the fine-tuned SpeechT5 model to Coqui TTS in both English and Hindi tasks demonstrates its superior performance in terms of pronunciation accuracy, naturalness, and Mean Opinion Score (MOS).

In summary, SpeechT5 has proven to be a robust model for TTS, excelling in technical English and Hindi speech generation, with room for further optimizations and language expansion.
